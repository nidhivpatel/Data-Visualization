For each choice of dimension d ∈ [2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^10], sample 100 points from the unit cube, and recorded the following average distances between all pairs of points, as well as the standard deviation of
the distances.
1. Squared Euclidean (or squared ℓ2) distance = ||x − y||2 = (X − Y )^2
2. Manhattan Distance (or ℓ1) distance = ||x − y||1 = |X − Y |

Code contains plotting of both the average and standard deviation of pairwise distances as a function of d.
